A simple batch script for searching up and displaying card art on an OBS livestream. 

- Drop the Record Reconstructor .bat file in a folder alongside your properly named card art.
- Launch the .bat file. In the console, input the name of a card and press enter. When inputting card names, press 'tab' to autocomplete entries.
- This will create a new file - '_preview.png' - in the same folder as the .bat file.
- Add '_preview.png' as an image source in your livestreaming software, such as OBS.
- Record Reconstructor can now be used to search up a given card, and it will live update the '_preview.png' in OBS.
